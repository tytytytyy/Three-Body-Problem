## Three Body Problem

*Three Body Problem* delves into the unseen turbulence of love in all its forms—romantic, platonic, and collective. In this piece, love is not a stable bond but a gravitational entanglement: chaotic, unstable, and often leaving invisible fractures in its wake. Using TouchDesigner, an approximation of the three-body problem visualizes drifting spheres, colliding and looping in unresolved tension.

Projected onto two humans locked in a hug, these figures contain the inner chaos. The particles trace relational forces, neither harmonious nor violent, but constantly shifting in flux. Love, here, becomes a form of emotional physics: a force that pulls, pushes, and distorts everything in its path.

This work speaks not only to intimate relationships but to the broader infrastructure of human connection. Love is not merely a private experience but a societal force, shaped by proximity, pressure, and time. Even in stillness, love exerts a force. Even in closeness, distortion persists.

Drawing insight from Erich Fromm’s conceptualization of love as an active, transformative power, the piece underscores its capacity to mold both the individual psyche and the collective consciousness. Bell hooks’ perspective on love as a radical and collective act further informs this exploration, positioning love as a force that transcends personal intimacy, deeply interwoven with the dynamics of power, spatial relationships, and temporal evolution.

Through a minimalist yet resonant arrangement of bodies, loops, and orbits, the work opens a space to witness love as a shared experience, a form of yielding, and an inherently unpredictable journey.
